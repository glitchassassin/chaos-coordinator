This directory contains standard patterns and solutions for recurring problems encountered during development. It serves as institutional memory — especially useful for AI agents that need to produce consistent code across sessions.

## How to Use

- **Before solving a problem**, check here for an existing pattern.
- **After solving a recurring problem**, document the solution here so future sessions don't re-derive it.

## Contents

<!-- Add entries as patterns emerge during development -->

_No entries yet. Add files here as standard patterns and recurring solutions are identified._
